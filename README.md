Write a NodeJS API which takes a dictionary file (eg: `dictionary.txt`) as an input and does the following:

Example, imagine the `dictionary.txt` file contained the following words:

```
Chic
Car
Lottery
Ken
Man
Chicken
Post
Paper
Postman
```

Your program needs to return two word combinations that when joined together, returns another word which is also in the dictionary.

Example output:

```
Chic + Ken = Chicken
Post + Man = Postman
etc...
```

Submit the following:

1) Give us instructions on how to install and run your code
Ans. node program.js dictionary.txt
2) Treat this as if it was production code: we want to see code that's tested, is efficient and clean
Ans. Code correction and optimization is done.

When you finished the test, please zip the contents and send us the solution
